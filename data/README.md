## Data
This folder contains triangle meshes that are used in examples and tests. 
They come from different sources that we list below.
If no source is given then the mesh was done by us.

### Sources
 - `cactus/` This model was provided to us by Olga Sorkine-Hornung and taken from M. Botsch and O. Sorkine, "On Linear Variational Surface Deformation Methods". *IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics*. DOI: 10.1109/TVCG.2007.1054.1.
 - `faces/` These meshes are a selection from the so-called Spacetime Faces dataset that can be found here: https://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/stfaces/
 - `finger/` This is part of the skeleton hand from the Large Geometric Models Archive at Georgia Tech.
 - `noisyStanfordBunny.ply` Well, as the name says this is derived from the famous Stanford Bunny of The Stanford 3D Scanning Repository.
